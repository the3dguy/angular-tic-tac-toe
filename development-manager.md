# Software Development Manager

Cox Media Group Digital is a Python shop, and we're building one of the largest Django platforms ever -- scaled to serve API, web, mobile, and more for 100+ prominent newspaper, TV and radio sites. You will manage a team of developers and be held accountable for their growth as technologists and employees.

We've got the mentality of an independent startup along with the backing of an integrated broadcasting, publishing and digital media company with revenues exceeding $1.5 billion. We expect you to contribute your knowledge and expertise to the product development process from start to finish. We do what it takes to produce a superior product and we have a lot of fun getting that job done.
