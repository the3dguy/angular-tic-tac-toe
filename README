Intructions:
1. Fork this repo on github.
2. Create an app that can interactively play the game of Tic Tac Toe against another player and never lose.
3. Commit early and often, with good messages.
4. Push your code back to github and send me a pull request.

(Don't be offended when I don't actually pull. I will clone your repo and inspect it locally when I receive the request. This repo will be left solution-less for obvious reasons.)
